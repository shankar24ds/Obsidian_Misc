The displacement of an engine refers to the amount of charge it takes in for combustion per cycle. For example, if a bike is said to have an engine displacement of 600cc, then the engine, (or the piston to be precise) will suck in 600 cubic centimeters of charge (i.e. air+fuel) per cycle.

The potential energy in the fuel is converted into heat energy when the spark plug fires, the heat energy and resultant pressure push down on the piston which creates physical energy in the form of linear motion. The linear motion is transformed into rotational motion with the help of the crankshaft that rotates at high speed (revolutions per minute or rpm) sending twisting force through the clutch and gearbox which moderates it and delivers it to the rear wheel.

**Terminologies:**
- cc, displacement
- fourstroke, two stroke
- bore, stroke
- engine cylinder
- piston
- spark plug
- combustion
- suck, squeeze, bang, blow
- crankshaft
- RPM
- SI, CI Engine
- [[Torque&Power]]

**Random Points:**
- cc - stands for cubic centimetres
- cc is engine cylinder volume without piston
- bore - diameter, stroke - height
- In four-stroke cycle engines, both SI and CI, there are four strokes completing two rotations of the crankshaft.
- RPM stands for Rotations/Revolutions per minute.
